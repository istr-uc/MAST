In Seh_Dialog:
    null trans ref
Find where a seh_dialog is created.
When the seh_dilog is created  an ref_event_combo box is created
    The call to populate the list if items should be moved
    to a tater time, when the transaction is set

Seems that show_simple_event_handler is not invoked


At the end: remove the put lines
