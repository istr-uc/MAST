                       MAST Agenda
                       -----------

Version 1.1
-----------

   This version adds the following tools:

       Monoprocessor_Priority_Assignment
       Linear_HOPA
       Linear_Simulated_Annealing_Priority_Assignment      

   Work items:

   done- Add the "preassigned" attribute to fixed priority scheduling
         parameters and also to the immediate ceiling resources. This
         is a boolean attribute that controls whether the priority
         assignment tools and the ceiling calculation tools are or are
         not able to assign that priority or that ceiling. The
         defaults values for the "preassigned" attribute are:

           - if no priority or priority ceiling is specified,
             preassigned is False (we need to allow no parameters)
           - if a priority or priority ceiling is specified,
             preassigned is True

         But, of course, if the preassigned attribute is explicitly
	 set then its value is as specified, except as noted below

         The preassigned field is always True for Interrupt_FP_Policy
         schedulers, regardless of the preassigned field in the input
         file

         The "assign priorities" option also implies the "calculate
         ceilings" option.

   done - Update gmast to include the new configuration options
         required by the priority assignment techniques

   done - Review the changes made to mast

   done - Write documentation, including description of parameters file

Version 1.2
-----------

   This version extends the linear model adding the delay, offset,
   and rate_divisor event handlers. This has required adding the
   following fields in the description of each task in the linear
   translation:
 
done:
      - Delay (Delayij): represents an amount to be added to the offset
        inherited by task ij from the previous task

done:
      - Offset (Oijstatic): represents a minimum amount of offset to
        be used for the task. The actual offset will be the maximum of
        the inherited offset and this field. 

done:
      - Maximum Offset (Oijmax): represents the maximum amount of offset
        specified in an offset event handler.

done:
   For rate divisors, the corresponding period transformation is made,
   and a static offset equal to (n-1) periods is set.

done:
   The following field is added to the transaction:

      - Input type (Trans_Input_Type) represents the type of the 
        input event of the transaction:
            External : external event
            Internal : external event coming from an an event handler
                       of the type activity, offset, delay, or rate divisor

   The implication is that the offset-based analysis is be capable
   of analyzing linear-plus systems, which are like the linear case
   but with delays, offsets, and rate-divisors. The holistic analysis
   will continue to be restricted to linear systems only.

Done:
   In addition, in this version we will eliminate the "independent
   analysis" flag in the description of the linear translation and,
   instead, make the independent tasks appear as independent
   transactions. The changes required are the following:

Done: 
     - The transactions in the translated system represent either
       whole linear transactions, or parts of them. Each transaction
       will have a Transaction_ID field to know where it comes
       from. If a transaction is split into several transactions, they
       will be placed immediately consecutive in the array, ordered
       according to their precedence in the original transaction.

Done:
     - Eliminate the independent analysis flag

Done:
     - Increase the maximum number of transactions, and introduce
       the number of valid transactions in the data structure. 
       To accomplish this, the transaction following the
       last valid transaction is marked as having zero tasks.

Done:
     - Check the translation of results

Done:
   Is the sporadic kind of event still applicable? Yes, because the
   fact that it may make the task independent is calculated
   dynamically, during the analysis
       
Done:
   We need to check if Linear_HOPA and Linear_Simulated_Annealing 
   need any change for Linear_Plus systems, and because of the new
   data structure.

done:
   Check any implications of linear plus for Calculate_Blocking_Times,
   and any other operation using the Linear_Translation operation.
        - Mast.restrictions.max_processor_utilization uses
          Linear_Translation to determine utilizations. It is not
          modified by offsets, deadlines, or rate divisors. It will be
          affected by multiple event systems
        - Mast.miscelaneous_tools.Calculate_Blockings uses
          Linear_Translation to determine remote blockings. It is not
          modified by offsets, deadlines, or rate divisors. It should
          not be affected by multiple-events, but we need to check.

Done:
   Change the analysis

Done (rule 14) 
   Add additional consistency check: rate divisors, offset and delay
   event handlers are only followed by activities

Version 1.4.1
-------------
  This version introduces new analysis tools and renames others

Version 1.4.2
-------------
   This version changes the treatment of rate divisors. It replicates the part
   of the transaction previous to the rate divisor and uses offsets

Version 1.5
-----------

   Support for join (barrier), fork (multicast) and merge
   (concentrator) event handlers, restricted to single input event
   transactions

     - The linear_translation package is modified to have a data
       structure where each transaction in the equivalent model has
       an array of successor transactions (null in case of a
       simple transaction) and an array of predecessor transactions
       (null in case of a transaction activated from an external
       event)

     - Each transaction input has a type, which can have one of the
       following three values:

          - external: this is a regular linear transaction coming from
            an external event

          - internal: this is a transaction being activated from the
            end of a single predecessor

          - join: this is part of a transaction that is right after a
            barrier(join), and thus inherits events from other
            transactions; these other transactions are referenced as
            predecessors .

     - The Translate_Analysis_Results operation was modified to
       put all the response times relative to the different events. If
       several response times exist for the same event, then the
       maximum of them shall be the final value.

   We also changed the implementation of Max_Processor_Utilization,
   which was restricted to linear plus systems only until now.

   We changed how the maximum transactions are calculated before
   the linear translation.

Version 1.6 (current version)
-----------------------------

     - Wa have adapted the offset-based analysis to multipath transactions
       with fork-join-merge elements

Version 2.0 (Under development)
-------------------------------

   Will have all the elements and tools of MAST 1.6 but using the new
   MAST-2 model


Changes to introduce in further versions:   
-----------------------------------------

     - Eliminate restriction of critical sections belonging to a
          single segment

     - Optimize calculation of remote  blockings

     - Do not collapse into same segment events with timing requirements

     - optimize initial values for response time analysis

     - Enhance the model of polling servers in the case when the
       polling period is equal to the period of the external event.
