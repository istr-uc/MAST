Testing mast analysis tools
---------------------------

Directories:
------------

.: contains the different example model files

patterns: this is where the results from a verified stable version are
          stored

results: this is where the results from the tests are stored. These
         results are compared to the patterns to check for differences.

Scripts:
--------

generate_pattern*: These scripts generate the patterns later used by
                   the test scripts. They are stored in the patterns
                   directory.  They use the mast_analysis_stable
                   program to perform the analysis

generate_test_patterns: Generates all the test patterns that do not exist

test_example*: These scripts run the analysis from the mast_analysis
	       program, which is the development version, and store
	       the results in the results directory. The results are
	       compared to the patterns from the patterns directory,
	       and differences are reported in the test_report file

test_mast_examples: Runs all the test_example scripts that are not present
                    in the results directory

view_results*: These scripts aid in viewwing the results stored in the
               patterns directory

Testing options:
----------------
The techniques and options are coded as:

rm: classic_rm
vp: varying_priorities
ho: holistic
ou: offset_based_approx
op: offset_based_approx_w_pr
os: offset_based_slanted

The _pa sufix indicates that a priority or scheduling parameters
assignment was performed

Procedures
----------
Run a test after modifying mast:
    rm results/*
    ./test_mast_examples

Prepare the patterns using a stable mast version:
    rm patterns/*
    ./generate_test_patterns

Regenerate the genetare_patterns script from the test_mast_examples script:
    cp test_mast_examples generate_test_patterns
    then edit generate_test_patters and replace './test_example' with
       './generate_pattern'
